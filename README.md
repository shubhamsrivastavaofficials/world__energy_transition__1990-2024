Global Energy Transition Analysis (1990–2024) Analyzing global energy trends, renewable adoption, and CO2 emissions across countries and continents using Python, pandas, and visualizations.

## Project Heading:
**Global Energy Transition Analysis (1990–2024)**

## Project Overview / What We Did:

1. **Data Collection & Loading:** Used country-wise yearly data on Coal, Oil, Gas, Renewable energy, and CO2 emissions. Loaded into Python using pandas.

2. **Data Cleaning & Preparation:** Handled missing values (numeric filled with mean, text with “Unknown”), removed duplicates, and added columns like Fossil Fuel Share and Continent.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Calculated statistics, visualized trends using line charts, bar charts, and pie charts, and analyzed top countries and regions in renewable adoption.

4. **Correlation & Impact Analysis:** Studied correlations between energy sources and analyzed the relationship between renewable energy share and CO2 emissions. Identified countries with highest CO2 reduction.

5. **Visualizations & Insights:** Created line charts, scatter plots, heatmaps, stacked bar charts, and pie charts for global and continental energy trends.

6. **Final Insights:** Renewable energy share is rising globally, fossil fuels are declining, and regions with higher renewables show lower CO2 emissions. Asia and Europe show the strongest growth momentum. Provides insights for policymakers, researchers, and energy stakeholders.
